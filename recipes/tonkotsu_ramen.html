            <li>Sliced pork belly or pork shoulder</li>
            <li>Soft-boiled eggs</li>
            <li>Sliced green onions</li>
            <li>Bamboo shoots (menma)</li>
            <li>Nori seaweed</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Black garlic oil (mayu)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Procedure:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the broth: In a large pot, combine the pork bones, onion, garlic, ginger, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for at least 6-8 hours, skimming off any foam and impurities that rise to the surface. The longer you simmer, the richer the broth will become.</li>
        <li>Strain the broth: Once the broth has simmered to your satisfaction, strain it through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth into another pot or large bowl. Discard the solids and return the broth to the pot. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Prepare the toppings: While the broth is simmering, prepare the toppings. Cook the pork slices in a skillet over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through. Soft-boil the eggs, peel them, and slice them in half. Slice the green onions, prepare the bamboo shoots, and toast the sesame seeds if desired.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles: Cook the fresh ramen noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Assemble the ramen: Divide the cooked noodles among serving bowls. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles, then arrange the pork slices, soft-boiled eggs, sliced green onions, bamboo shoots, and nori seaweed on top. Drizzle with black garlic oil (mayu) if desired, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately: Serve the tonkotsu ramen hot, with chopsticks and spoons for eating.</li>
    </ol>
