    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe makes 2 servings of Chinese style green onion dumplings.<br></p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>2 cups finely chopped green onions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: minced ginger, minced garlic, or other seasonings of your choice</li>
        <li>Dipping sauce: soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili oil, and/or sesame seeds for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Procedure:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: Place the flour in a mixing bowl and slowly add the boiling water while stirring continuously. Once the water is fully incorporated, knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling: In a separate bowl, mix together the finely chopped green onions, soy sauce, sesame oil, vegetable oil, salt, and any other seasonings you're using. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</li>
        <li>Form the dumplings: After the dough has rested, divide it into small pieces and roll each piece into a thin circle, about 3 inches in diameter. Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each circle.</li>
        <li>Fold and seal the dumplings: Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, then pinch the edges together to seal the dumpling. You can also pleat the edges for a decorative touch, if desired. Make sure the dumplings are tightly sealed to prevent the filling from leaking during cooking.</li>
        <li>Cook the dumplings: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the dumplings to the boiling water, making sure they don't stick together. Cook the dumplings for about 4-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface and the dough is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove the dumplings from the water using a slotted spoon and drain off any excess water. Serve the dumplings hot with your choice of dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
